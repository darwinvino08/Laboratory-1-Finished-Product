<h2>Quirk</h2>
<p>
	Voice (ヴォイス Voisu?): Hizashi's Quirk allows him to increase the volume of his voice, giving him an ability that is similar to a sonic scream. The sound from Hizashi's Quirk is strong enough to cause people's ears to bleed from far away.

The only known weakness of this Quirk is that the loud sounds do not travel well underground, making this Quirk ineffective against anything that is underground or separated from him by layers of earth.

Unknown Quirk: Lunch Rush possesses a Quirk of unknown name and unknown nature.
