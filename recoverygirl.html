<h2>Quirk</h2>
<p>
	Heal (癒いやし Iyashi?): Chiyo's Quirk allows her to amplify and speed up the human body's natural healing process by planting a kiss on the injured person. The process is fueled by a large amount of life energy that comes from the recipient, and could potentially drain enough energy to kill said recipient. She also seems to be able to stretch her lips to an abnormal length.

With this Quirk, she is able to quickly heal broken bones in several limbs in a matter of seconds. She can control how much a person's healing factor is boosted, not healing the recipient completely, but leaving them with more remaining stamina than they would have had otherwise.

This Quirk is not able to regrow lost body parts.[3]
