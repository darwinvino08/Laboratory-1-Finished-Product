		<h1> Izuki Midoriya</h1>
<p> NIzuku Midoriya (緑みどり谷や出いず久く Midoriya Izuku?), also known as Deku (デク Deku?), is the primary protagonist of the My Hero Academia manga and anime series.

Though born Quirkless, Izuku manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero All Might due to his innate heroism and strong sense of justice and has since become his close pupil as well as a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School. All Might passed on his Quirk to Izuku, making him the ninth holder of One For All

<h2>Quirk</h2>
<p>
	One For All (ワン・フォー・オール Wan Fō Ōru?): Transfered to him from Toshinori Yagi, Izuku's Quirk allows him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to a superhuman level. This results in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, agility, and durability.

Izuku can focus the stockpiled power into a single body part, or spread it across his entire body evenly, though, focusing the power in a single part puts greater strain on that part of his body. He is also able to control what percentage of his full power that he uses. He is currently able to handle 45% of his full power without breaking his bones, with 30% being his normal output.

The Quirk factors of the previous power holders have merged with the core of One For All and have drastically increased in strength since. This grants Izuku the ability to access and utilize the Quirks of the previous holders of One For All.
