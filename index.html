<a name="up"><h2>STORY</h2></a>
	<p>People are not born equal, a realization that four-year-old <a href="#down">Izuku Midoriya</a>  faced when bullied by his classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born with absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of becoming a great hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to become, he will now join the ranks of one of the highest rated <strong>"Hero Academies"</strong> in the country: <a href="#down2">U.A. High School</a>. With the help of his idol <a href="#down1">All Might</a>, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero? </p>
	<hr>

	<h2>SETTING</h2>
	
<p>The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the human population has gained the ability to develop superpowers called "Quirks" (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk. There are infinite types of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to find two people who have the exact same power, unless they are closely related. These particular abilities have allowed the development of a new category of people: Heroes, who face the evil-voted individuals who use the Quirks for selfish and criminal purposes, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who choose to exercise heroism at work level are recognized as Pro Heroes. Unless the individual is registered as a <a href="#down3"> Pro Hero</a>, the voluntary use of his or her Quirk in public places is considered a crime, except in exceptional cases.</p>
<hr>
	<h2> QUIRKS</h2>
	<p> Quirk (個性 Kosei?, lit. "Individuality"), also known as a Meta Ability (異能 Inō?) by the Meta Liberation Army,[1] is a special, superhuman ability that a person can have.

	Along with being unique to each user, Quirks are compartmentalized into multiple categories. Quirk users are also limited to one ability and are thus unable to achieve any other. <br><br>
	Quirks have been collected into three categories: </p>

	<ul>
		 <li><strong>Emitter</strong></li> <p>(発動, Hatsudō, lit. "Activation")-type Quirk is the most widely used, which gives the ability to produce and release substances or alter the materials within certain limits. As the name indicates, this type of Quirk needs conscious use and, at times, good concentration skills, especially for prolonged use; </p>
		 <li><strong>Transformation</li></strong><p> (変形, Henkei)-type Quirk allows the user to temporarily transform his body or part of it in order to obtain physical enhancement or additional skills. With some exceptions, the alterations due to this type of Quirk affect only the users themselves;</p>
		 <li><strong>Mutant </strong></li> <p> (異形, Igyō)-type Qurik always keeps passively active amplifying or altering functions and abilities of an organism and, for this reason, induces in the wearer far greater bodily mutations than other types, which makes wearers of this type of Quirk easily recognizable. Managing control of these skills requires training and, however, the resulting mutations can cause problems or inconvenience for users.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3> HISTORY OF QUIRKS</h3>
	The first person in the world to manifest a Quirk was a newborn baby in Qing Qing City, China; the baby had the ability to emanate light from their body.

	After that phenomenon, many people around the world began to manifest different kinds of superpowers. While the cause of the Quirk phenomenon is unknown, it has been theorized that the development of Quirks was caused by the spread of a virus carried by mice. These superpowers were first referred to as Meta Abilities before later being called Quirks
