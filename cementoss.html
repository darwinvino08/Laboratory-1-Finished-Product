<h2>Quirk</h2>
<p>
	Cement (セメント Semento): Ken's Quirk allows him to manipulate any cement-based material that he touches, allowing him to deform the object into various shapes and sizes, changing it’s appearance. His Quirk doesn't appear to have a time limit, and Recovery Girl mentioned his Quirk is among the most difficult of the U.A. teachers to fight against.
