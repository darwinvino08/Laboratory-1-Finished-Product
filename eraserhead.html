<h2>Quirk</h2>
<p>
	Erasure (抹まっ消しょう Masshō?): Shota's Quirk gives him the ability to nullify another person's Quirk by looking at the user. The effects of this Quirk can still last even if Shota's line of vision is out of range. [13]

After sustaining grievous injuries at the U.S.J., Shota can't use his Quirk for as long and must rest longer between erasures.[12]
