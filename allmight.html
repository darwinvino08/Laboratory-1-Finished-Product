		<h1> AllMight</h1>
<p> Toshinori Yagi (八や木ぎ俊とし典のり Yagi Toshinori?), more commonly known by his hero name, All Might (オールマイト Ōru Maito?), is the tritagonist of My Hero Academia. All Might is the former No. 1 Pro Hero who bore the title of the world's Symbol of Peace (平和の象徴 Heiwa no Shōchō?). He teaches Foundational Hero Studies at U.A. High School.

All Might was the eighth holder of the One For All Quirk after receiving it from Nana Shimura. He has since passed the torch to Izuku Midoriya, whom he is grooming to be his successor. After using up all the embers of One For All to defeat All For One, All Might retired and ended his era as the world's greatest hero.

<h2>Quirk</h2>
<p>
	One For All (ワン・フォー・オール Wan Fō Ōru?): Transferred to him from Nana Shimura, Toshinori's Quirk allowed him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to a superhuman level. This results in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, agility, and durability.

All Might was so proficient with One For All that he was widely known as the world's most powerful person. However, most of the feats he performed are after All Might had started the process of transferring One For All to Izuku, so the fullest extent of his abilities are partially unknown.
Quirk
Unknown Quirk: Lunch Rush possesses a Quirk of unknown name and unknown nature.
